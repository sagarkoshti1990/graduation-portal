# MyApp Project Rules

## 1. Library and Package Selection - Native and Web Compatibility

Whenever choosing or recommending any new library or package for this project:

- Always verify compatibility with both React Native (iOS/Android) and React Web platforms
- Check that the library has native and web implementations or appropriate fallbacks
- Consider platform-specific alternatives when a single library doesn't support both platforms
- Test on both platforms before finalizing the integration

## 2. Documentation File Creation

Before creating any documentation (.md) files:

- Always ask the user first: "Do you want to create this documentation file or skip it?"
- Only proceed with file creation if the user explicitly agrees
- This includes README files, guides, and any markdown documentation

## 3. Package Manager Selection

Before installing or adding any npm or yarn package:

- Always ask the user: "Which package manager do you want to use â€” yarn or npm?"
- Use the selected package manager for the installation
- Maintain consistency with the project's existing setup (note: this project uses yarn.lock)

## 4. UI Component Styling - Gluestack UI Priority

Whenever creating any UI component:

- **Always use Gluestack UI components and styling first** (from `@gluestack-ui/themed`)
- Gluestack UI should be the default choice for all UI elements (Box, Button, Text, Input, VStack, HStack, etc.)
- Only if the desired UI/styling **cannot be achieved** using Gluestack UI, then ask the user: "This styling cannot be achieved with Gluestack UI. Do you want me to use React Native StyleSheet instead?"
- Wait for user confirmation before falling back to `StyleSheet.create()`
- This ensures consistency with the project's design system and maintainability
